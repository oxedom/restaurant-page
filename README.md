# restaurant-page

Restaurant page was my first time playing with WebPack hands on, 
the goal of the project was to create a simple webpage with basic routing that are 
based off Javascript modules (Sort of like components), Even though my website isn't going to impress Gordon Ramasy, I'mquite proud of how clean and how the logic was executed. On top of that I made the dom function a IEFF to not polute the Dom environment, good on me ;)

I thought webkit was going to be a lot more indimidating than what it was (I'm sure It has a deep rabbit hole) and overall I really enjoyed this topic of theOdinProject, gives you a real behind the scenes of how things work on a vanilla level.
