# restaurant-page

Restaurant page was my first time playing with webpack hands on, 
the goal of the project was to create a simple webpage with basic routing that is 
based off Javascript modules (foreshadowing framework components), Even though the website isn't going to impress Gordon Ramasy, I'm proud of how clean the logic was executed.

I thought webkit was going to be a lot more indimidating than what it really was (I'm sure It has a deep rabbit hole) and overall I really enjoyed this topic of theOdinProject, gives you a real insight of how things work in Frameworks on a vanilla level.
